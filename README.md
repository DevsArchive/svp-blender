# Sega Virtua Processor Blender Plugin

This is my incomplete plugin for Blender that adds Sega Virtua Processor support. This includes importing and exporting SVP models, added modeling options and a rendering engine.

However, it is missing a key component to getting models to render correctly via the SVP, and that is the proper implementation of a flag that seems to be used for Z-sorting. I've never gotten it figured out, so it's left unimplemented here.

The code is also a massive hack job, because of Blender limitations (and also because of Python sometimes, but I'm also a bit of a Python noob, too, so lol). The rendering engine could be optimized quite a bit, and the code in general could use some restructuring. However, I have no intention of returning to this, as I am now caught up with other interests, projects, and real life crap. However, feel free to go ahead and pick this back up if you want.
